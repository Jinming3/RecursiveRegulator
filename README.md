The identification methods "Recursive Regulator" focuses on nonlinear systems and real-time model adaptation.

Language: Python 3.10

Installation requirements: 

numpy 

torch 

matplotlib

scipy

statsmodels

Three system examples: 

in "RecursiveRegulator", 'update_{system}.py' contains varying system data and recursive regulator to adapt trained model, e.g., update_RLC.py. 

'train_{system}.py' is to train and save nonlinear model for static systems.

If the package path had problem, please change the path to obsolute, e.g., "F:/head...".
