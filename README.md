The identification methods "Recursive Regulator" focuses on nonlinear systems and real-time model adaptation.

Language: Python 3.10

File structure: 
system examples in "RecursiveRegulator", update_system.py contains varying system data and recursive regulator adapting trained model, e.g., update_RLC.py. train_system.py is to train NN model in static system.

The package path may be obsolute in some of the files, e.g., "F:/Project/head...". Please download the folder "head" and change the path.
