The identification methods "Recursive Regulator" focuses on nonlinear systems and real-time model adaptation.


# Installation requirements:

Language: Python 3.10

numpy 

torch 

matplotlib

scipy

statsmodels

# System examples:

In "RecursiveRegulator", 'update_{system}.py' uses varying system data to test the recursive regulator for adapting trained model, e.g., update_RLC.py. 

'train_{system}.py' is to train and save nonlinear model of static systems.

If the package path had problem, please change the path to obsolute, e.g., "F:/head...".
