The identification methods "Recursive Regulator" focuses on nonlinear systems and real-time model adaptation.

Language: Python 3.10

System examples: 
in "RecursiveRegulator", "update_system.py" contains varying system data and recursive regulator adapting trained model, e.g., update_RLC.py. 
"train_system.py" is to train and save nonlinear model for static systems.

If the package path had problem, please change the path to obsolute, e.g., "F:/head...".
